The proposed HPC-XGB methodology learns to classify priority for COVID-19 vaccine administration using the Italian Federation of General Practitioners dataset, which is an Electronic Health Record data of 17k patients collected by 11 General Practitioners.


# Usage
*XGB_Vacc_Prior_ModelA.py* -->The first layer A focuses on the classification between the high vulnerable patients and the other categories. 

*XGB_Vacc_Prior_ModelB_binary.py*  --> The second layer  focuses on discriminating the priority classes in a specific age range categories (binary task).

*XGB_Vacc_Prior_ModelB_multi.py*  --> The second layer  focuses on discriminating the priority classes in a specific age range categories (multiclass task).

*select_pc.py*--> convert input/output data into the A, B task.

Notice how the validation procedure is not reported in the script, i.e. each split of the outer loop was trained with the optimal hyperparameters tuned in the inner loop (found in the previous experiments).

# Dataset
The Hierarchical Priority Classification eXtreme Gradient Boosting aims to provide priority classification for COVID-19 vaccine administration using the Italian Federation of General Practitioners dataset (FIMMG_COVID) that contains Electronic Health Record data of 17k patients. We measured the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for classifying all the priority classes while demonstrating a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art. The proposed ML approach, which is integrated into a clinical decision support system, is currently supporting General Pracitioners in assigning COVID-19 vaccine administration priorities to their assistants. https://mailchi.mp/netmedicaitalia/prisma-7577657
